        <h1>Rust Development Studio - CGI</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>To transform any browser to a powerful development environment. It doesn't matter where a browser does  run.
        It can be a desktop, a laptop, a tablet and even a phone. Everything can be done
        in the browser from beginning of a project, establish a git repository, develop, debug, document,
        test and finally publish your product.</p>
        <h2>Getting started</h2>
        <p>The RDS operates with projects. A project is some directory inside HOME directory, which is an essential
        part of RDS configuration. The project directory can address an entire physical project directory or be just
        a part of it. </p>
        <p>The RDS understands if the project directory is a part of GIT controlled source tree.</p>
        <p> There is no any project when the RDS first time ran. Use <i>File&gt;Project&gt;New...</i> to assign a project name and
        the project directory. If you didn't specify any project name, then it's considered <i>default</i>. A project
        directory will be created automatically, unless it's already there.
        You can start using RDS now.</p>
        <p>You can clone a project directory from a source control system using the terminal window.</p>
        <h3>Note about GIT</h3>
        <p>Selecting VCS&gt;Status will show modified/staged/unversioned files.
        You need to mark files to include them in the commit operation. Just click
        any file of interest, and it will slightly change color indicating that
        it is marked. Clicking it again will unmark it. The rest of operations
        looks obvious.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>The client part is a quite obvious and utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But the server part resurrects the forgotten CGI technology which is perfectly
 suitable for using Rust. The terminal
functionality is implemented using Websocket and it utilizes WS-CGI. Everything is written in Rust
 including web server, and client is HTML/CSS, JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>
It's a really compact with a footprint below 10 MB. All web requests are handled by one Rust executable.
  The terminal is a websocket endpoint represented by another Rust executable.
</p>
<h2>Config</h2>
<p>
The following portion has to be added in <b>"mapping"</b> section of SimHttp <i>env.conf</i>  :</p>
<pre>
      {"path":"/cgires/resource",
       "CGI": false,
       "translated": "./rds/resource"},
      {"path":"/rustcgi",
       "CGI": true,
       "translated": "./rds"},
      {"path":"/terminal",
       "WS-CGI": true,
       "translated": "./rds/terminal"},
</pre>

<p>
Make  sure also that the directory, where rustcgi accessed from, contains the file .home with one line containing the user HOME directory or other directory
where rustcgi will look for settings in the sub directory .rustcgi of <b>HOME</b>.
</p>
<pre>
/home/john
</pre>

<h2>Packaging</h2>
<p>
    <b>install</b> subdirectory of the RDS source directory tree contains 
    <a href="https://github.com/vernisaz/rust_dev_studio/blob/master/install/bee.7b">bee.7b</a>. Inspect it
    to better understand which components will be required for the RDS deployment.
</p>
<p>
Four underline OS executables written in Rust are:
</p>
<pre>
rb
rustcgi
terminal
simhttp
</pre><p>SimHttp doesn't support HTTPS, so use any HTTPS proxy. Later, the feature will be added to SimHttp.</p>
